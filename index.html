            <h3>About us:</h3>
            <p>
                Our team is made of people who have worked at Auto parts departments at car dealerships, and at Auto parts stores. From our experience we found that many customers, unfortunately, decide to scrap their vehicles, as sometimes it’s cost-prohibitive for them to fix them, due to the high cost of brand-new, and aftermarket parts as well as the high cost of labour charged by mechanics. This is our solution to this problem: <strong><i>Providing the customers with Quality Used car parts at competitive prices.</strong></i>
                If you even have the mechanical inclination, there are many resources for you to refer to, to do many car repair jobs yourself! Or if the job is too complicated or dangerous, you can buy the parts through us and have them installed by your mechanic and it would still be worth your while when for you even after paying for the shipping fees. Used parts average between 25-60% of an equivalent aftermarket new part, and about 10-20% of equivalent new OEM parts at the dealerships! To give you an examples, a starter at the dealership for a vehicle X, would cost about 560$++. An after market is about 60% less. From AGP, equivalent starter with the shipping fees, would cost you no more than 85$. Bear in mind that some parts can only be purchased at car dealerships, as there is no aftermarket equivalent. A very high percentage of used car parts can be recycled and reused again, as they are not wear and tear part. I.e, valve covers, steering knuckles, some suspension components, steering columns, most of the body parts, cargo covers for station wagons, …etc. Pretty much all cars have car-repair manuals that adequately explain how to do many repair jobs, and with the availability of the internet.</p>

            </p>
